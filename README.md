# MIPSPatterns

A resource for common coding structures in MIPS.

It's often difficult to translate high level programming structures that are
often delimited by punctuation or indentation into the mostly syntax-free
environment that is MIPS assembly. This resource aims to provide general
patterns for beginning users to adapt for their needs as well as provide
explanations that allow them to combine the different structures and eventually
extend them to solve more subtle problems.

In this way, these files are meant to be _suggestions_ or _aids_, ___not___
rules and laws. This is not the only way to solve your problems but it can help
you get started.

Each file has two versions, one in `explained/` and another in `simplified/`.
The version in `explained/` contains explanation and descriptions of why and how
we do things as well as where things go and what things do. The version in
`simplified/` has nothing but the bare minimum of comments in an effort to
distill the structure. Some of the explanations are rather long so the
simplified files assume you already know why something might be done in a
certain way.

The content is divided up as follows:
